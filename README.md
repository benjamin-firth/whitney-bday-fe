# Whitney's Birthday Attendance Counter

This app was created so that people could see how many people were at Whitney's Birthday get together, and decide if they felt safe with that during Covid.

I created a backend server, so that people could add themselves to the attendees as they arrived, and the count would go up.

It's largely a mobile app, but works on the computer as well.

## EDIT

This was later used for another friends birthday. The new site can be accessed at https://victorias-bday-surprise.herokuapp.com/
